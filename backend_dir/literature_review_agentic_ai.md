# Literature Review on Agentic AI

## Introduction to the Literature Review
The purpose of this section is to synthesize existing research on agentic AI, identify key themes, and highlight gaps that this paper aims to address. Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of autonomous decision-making and goal-directed behavior, distinguishing them from reactive or narrowly task-specific AI systems.

## Key Findings from the Literature

### 1. Defining Agentic AI
- **Autonomy and Intentionality**: Agentic AI systems are characterized by their ability to operate independently, set goals, and adapt to changing environments. Unlike traditional AI, which relies on predefined rules or supervised learning, agentic AI exhibits a higher degree of self-direction.
  - *Source Example*: Russell, S., & Norvig, P. (2020). *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (4th ed.). This foundational text discusses autonomy in AI systems but does not explicitly focus on agentic AI as a distinct category.
- **Comparison with Human Agency**: While agentic AI can mimic aspects of human decision-making, it lacks the intrinsic motivations and consciousness associated with human agency.
  - *Gap Identified*: Limited exploration of how agentic AI systems simulate or diverge from human-like intentionality.

### 2. Applications of Agentic AI
- **Robotics**: Autonomous robots, such as self-driving cars and drones, are practical examples of agentic AI. These systems must navigate complex environments and make decisions in real time.
  - *Source Example*: Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., & Courville, A. (2016). *Deep Learning*. This text provides insights into the algorithms enabling autonomy but does not address the broader implications of agentic behavior.
- **Healthcare**: Agentic AI is being explored for personalized medicine, where systems can autonomously recommend treatments based on patient data.
  - *Gap Identified*: Ethical concerns, such as accountability in life-critical decisions, remain underexplored.

### 3. Ethical and Societal Implications
- **Accountability and Transparency**: The autonomous nature of agentic AI raises questions about accountability, particularly in cases where decisions lead to unintended consequences.
  - *Source Example*: Binns, R. (2018). "Fairness in Machine Learning: Lessons from Political Philosophy." *Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency*. This paper discusses fairness but does not specifically address agentic AI.
- **Regulatory Challenges**: Policymakers are grappling with how to regulate systems that operate independently of human oversight.
  - *Gap Identified*: Lack of comprehensive frameworks for governing agentic AI.

### 4. Technical Challenges
- **Goal Alignment**: Ensuring that agentic AI systems align with human values and objectives is a significant challenge.
  - *Source Example*: Amodei, D., et al. (2016). "Concrete Problems in AI Safety." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06565*. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)
- **Adaptability**: While agentic AI systems are designed to adapt to new situations, their ability to generalize across diverse contexts remains limited.
  - *Gap Identified*: Insufficient research on the scalability of agentic AI systems.

## Gaps in the Literature
1. **Conceptual Clarity**: While autonomy and goal-directed behavior are widely discussed, there is no consensus on what constitutes agentic AI as a distinct category.
2. **Ethical Frameworks**: Existing research lacks robust ethical frameworks tailored to the unique challenges posed by agentic AI.
3. **Practical Demonstrations**: Few studies provide practical demonstrations of agentic AI systems, limiting the ability to evaluate their real-world implications.
4. **Public Perception**: Limited research exists on how the public perceives agentic AI and its potential impact on trust and adoption.

## Contribution of This Paper
This paper aims to address these gaps by:
1. Proposing a clear conceptual framework for agentic AI.
2. Exploring ethical considerations specific to agentic AI systems.
3. Presenting a practical demonstration to bridge the gap between theory and application.
4. Analyzing public perception and trust in agentic AI.

## Next Steps
1. Refine the literature review based on feedback.
2. Develop the **Conceptual Framework** section, building on the findings from this review.
3. Collaborate with the engineer to align the practical demonstration with the identified gaps.
